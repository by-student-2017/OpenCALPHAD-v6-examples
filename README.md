# OpenCALPHAD-v6-examples
- Note 1: The "map" can not be created well in many systems. I tried various TDBs of "CPDDB", but OpenCALPHAD should be considered to be of limited use. 
- Note 2: If you want to draw trigonometric phase diagrams, pycalphad is recommended. Examples files are also available here (https://github.com/by-student-2017/pycalphad-v.0.10.3-examples.git).

## B-Fe-Nd
- Development of a prototype thermodynamic database for Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets. T.Abe, et al., STAM, 22, (2021), 557-570. doi.org/10.1080/14686996.2021.1936627
- It is sufficient to create an input file that shows results consistent with the above paper. With my ability, it is difficult to show results beyond what is shown in the test folder. hope readers will consider this.
- I am preparing this as a test. I think it's worth using demo versions of Pandat and other commercial software if they match up roughly.
- If the crystal structure is clear from the above calculation, use Akai-KKR to perform element substitution and calculate the formation energy. The formation energy obtained with Akai-KKR should be used as a reference only, as the structure may be retained even if it is somewhat energetically disadvantageous due to effects such as entropy.
- VASP (QE, OpenMX, Siesta or ...) etc. can take into account the displacement of atomic positions, but because the calculation cost is high, this is done after checking the element substitution situation with Akai-KKR. If you can create an appropriate potential for molecular dynamics, it is best to use it to optimize the structure and finally confirm it using VASP (QE, OpenMX, Siesta or ...), etc.
- e.g., (B, Al, Ga)-(Fe, Co, Cu)-(Nd, Dy) system
- It is good to remember that machine learning potentials other than graph neural networks become unstable in systems with four or more elements. Graph neural networks are not easily available, so I don't know how reliable they are.
- If you only need ternary phase diagrams, pycalphad is recommended. It is very unfortunate that in the current state of development, it is not possible to draw a ternary system phase diagram by fixing other elements such as a quaternary system.
- I'm not particularly confident about "heat capacity". Just tried it.
- As written in the "Note" section below, discussing Coercivity is impossible unless the organization is also considered. The phase field method is used to understand the relationship between tissue and magnetism.
- Note 1: Since most of the region inside the magnet is the T1 phase, the alloy composition is located near the stoichiometric composition of the T1 phase within the (T1+L) region.
- Note 2: The end of the tie line on the liquid phase side varies greatly depending on the local average composition of Nd around the grain boundary position. This is the reason why the experimental data changed.
- Note 3: In a metastable phase diagram (for example, at 873 K), only two phases, the T1 phase and the liquid phase, are considered.
- Note 4: Coercivity cannot be obtained unless Nd is precipitated at a reasonably high concentration at the grain boundaries (2-3 nm width).
- Note 5: If there is less Nd in the grain boundaries, Fe will mainly exist and will not act as a barrier to domain wall movement, resulting in a decrease in coercive force. 
- Note 6: steady stateï¼šFe-5at%B-15at%Nd
